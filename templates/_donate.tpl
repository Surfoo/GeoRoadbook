        <p>GeoRoadbook has specific needs to works, so it's hosted on a dedicated server and it's not free.
        Of course, GeoRoadbook will be always free and open source, and I will support all costs.</p>

        <p>However, many people use GeoRoadbook sometimes it can be very slow and overload the server (basic price) and I can't spend more money on the server.<p>

        <p>So, if you like this app and use it, you can donate some money to help me to support costs, and I'll upgrade the server if I have a sufficient donations.</p>

        <p>Thanks a lot!</p>
